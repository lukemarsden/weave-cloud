<h2>Who are you?</h2>

<p>Hi, my name's Björn. I'm a fictional full-stack developer in a devops team.
I've chosen to adopt cloud-native application development using containers &amp; microservices because I want to accelerate delivery.
On this page I'm going to show you how Weave Cloud helps me at different stages of my application development lifecycle.</p>

<h2>What are we going to be looking at?</h2>

<p>This diagram shows everything we'll be looking at below.
It might look scary at first but don't worry, it will all make sense when you watch the videos below.</p>

<h2>Boot microservices locally, check app in Weave Scope</h2>
<div style="float:right; width:530px;">
    <!-- WORDS HERE -->
    <p>In this example, we'll take a look at my application, which is a socks shop, by booting it up in Docker on my laptop, using <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/">Docker</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/overview/">Docker Compose</a>, and plug it into Weave Scope.</p>
    <p><em>Goal: run the app on my laptop, and check that it’s working</em></p>
    <p>You can find the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/microservices-demo/microservices-demo/tree/master/deploy/docker-only">Docker Compose file here</a>. Start it up like this:</p>
    <pre>$ git clone \
  https://github.com/microservices-demo/microservices-demo
$ cd deploy/docker-only
$ docker-compose up -d</pre>
    <p>Then plug it into a <a target="_blank" href="https://cloud.weave.works">Weave Cloud account</a> and run:
    <pre>$ sudo curl -L git.io/scope -o /usr/local/bin/scope
$ sudo chmod a+x /usr/local/bin/scope
$ scope launch --service-token=&lt;token&gt;</pre>
    <p>Replacing <code>&lt;token&gt;</code> with your Weave Cloud token.</p>
    <p><strong>Problem solved: it's hard to see how all the components in my microservices app interact when I'm running them locally in development.</strong></p>
</div>

</div>
<div style="clear:both;"></div>


<h2>Set up prod container platform, deploy app, check it’s the same in Weave Scope</h2>
<div style="float:right; width:530px;">
    <!-- WORDS HERE -->
    <p>In this example, we'll create a Kubernetes cluster and then deploy the socks shop on it.</p>
    <p><em>Goal: deploy &amp; visualize my app consistently across dev and prod</em></p>
    <p>Start by <a target="_blank" href="http://kubernetes.io/docs/getting-started-guides/kubeadm/">creating a Kubernetes cluster using kubeadm</a>.</p>
    <p>Note: this example uses Kubernetes, but Weave Cloud intends to fully support Docker Swarm, Mesos and DC/OS soon.</p>
    <p>Then install the socks shop using:</p>
    <pre>$ kubectl apply -f \
  microservices-demo/deploy/kubernetes/manifests</pre>
    <p>Finally, <a target="_blank" href="https://cloud.weave.works/instances/create">create a new instance in Weave Cloud</a> and then run:</p>
    <pre>$ kubectl apply -f \
  'https://cloud.weave.works/launch/k8s/weavescope.yaml\
?service-token=&lt;token&gt;'</pre>
    <p>Replacing <code>&lt;token&gt;</code> with your Weave Cloud token.</p>
    <p><strong>Problem solved: it's hard to confirm that an app has been successfully deployed the same in production as it was when I was running it in development.</strong></p>
</div>

<h2>Fast iteration using CI/CD pipeline using Weave Flux</h2>
<div style="float:right; width:530px;">
    <!-- WORDS HERE -->
    <p>In this example, I'll configure a CI/CD pipeline which includes: a CI system (<a target="_blank" href="https://travis-ci.org">Travis-CI</a>), a docker registry (<a target="_blank" href="https://quay.io">Quay.io</a>), Weave Flux and <a target="_blank" href="http://kubernetes.io">Kubernetes</a>.
    <p><em>Goal: commit and push code and automatically deploy it to production</em></p>
    <p>To reproduce this demo yourself, see <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BNDYGnTKdyZ_dG_FUyhySligV4YI67jgasyZHbnK4fI/edit#heading=h.8thkkns7sirz">these detailed instructions</a>, which starts with making a fork of the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/microservices-demo/microservices-demo/">microservices-demo configuration repo</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/microservices-demo/front-end/">the front-end code repo</a> to your own GitHub repo.</p>
    <p><strong>Problem solved: my frontend developers shouldn't need to know about the details of Kubernetes to deploy simple code changes. They should be able to just <code>git push</code>.</strong></p>
</div>

<div style="clear:both;"></div>


<h2>Monitor microservices metrics with Weave Prism</h2>
<div style="float:right; width:530px;">
    <!-- WORDS HERE -->
    <p>In this example, I'll set up monitoring for my microservices so that I can check whether they're healthy and dig into production issues, e.g. performance.</p>
    <p><em>Goal: collect detailed metrics from my application, query historical data</em></p>
    <p>To reproduce this demo yourself, see <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BNDYGnTKdyZ_dG_FUyhySligV4YI67jgasyZHbnK4fI/edit#heading=h.luz5i842w3bg">these detailed instructions</a>.</p>
    <p><strong>Problem solved: I need to be able to monitor my application, and for rapidly-changing dynamic deployments, legacy monitoring tools that are statically configured don't work well. So I choose Prometheus. But Prometheus is hard to manage on my own, because it runs on a single server and isn't scalable, and so I would like someone else to run it for me.</strong></p>

</div>
<div style="clear:both;"></div>


<h2>Security with network policy &amp; segmentation with Weave Net Policy</h2>
<div style="float:right; width:530px;">
    <!-- WORDS HERE -->
    <p>In this example, I'll firewall off unrelated services by applying Kubernetes policy which isolates components of my app which don't need to talk to eachother.</p>
    <p><em>Goal: create network policy that firewalls unrelated services</em></p>
    <p>Applying the policy is as simple as:</p>
    <pre>$ kubectl apply -f &lt;path-to-policy-files&gt;</pre>
    <p><strong>Problem solved: I need security in depth to satisfy regulatory and business security policy requirements, and so I need to isolate unrelated services in my microservices application.</strong></p>
